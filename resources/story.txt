A Story About a Duck .
A Duck is walking down the sidewalk and stops at the door of a tavern. The Duck asks the bartender: Do you have any duck food? The bartender replies: Nope, there is no duck food here. The Duck waddles off. The Duck returns the next day and again asks: Do you have any duck food? The bartender is losing his patience and replies: NO DUCK FOOD! The third day, the Duck asks again: Do you have any duck food today? The bartender throws down his towel and yells at the duck : No! And if you ask me again, I am going to take a hammer and nails and nail your beak shut and hit you on the head! The Duck waddles off a little sad and thinking hard. On the 4th day the Duck pauses at the door. The Duck carefully asks: Do you have any hammer and nails? The bartender yells: NO, I DON'T HAVE A HAMMER AND NAILS! The Duck exclaims: Oh, good have any duck food?
